This subfolder `/img360` contains a collection of equirectangular images for use in 360 degree images in web based [3D modelling](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/3D_Modelling) scenes.

## Overview

The images in this subfolder are designed to be used with popular AR frameworks, including:

* A-Frame: A open-source framework for building immersive AR experiences using HTML and JavaScript.
* AR.js: A JavaScript library for building AR experiences that run in the browser. With the equirectangular image it is possible to replace temporily the AR camera background with an equirectangular panoramic view (e.g. to compare historic scene of a city with the current view in augemented reality and the camera stream).
* Geolocated AR: Experiences that use the device's location and camera to superimpose virtual objects onto real-world locations. Equirectangular images can be used

## Image Format

All images in this subfolder are in equirectangular format, which is a 2:1 aspect ratio panorama that can be used to create immersive 360-degree experiences.

## Usage

To use these images in your AR project, simply copy the desired image into your project directory and reference it in your code. Make sure to adjust the image's dimensions and formatting as needed to match your project's requirements.
